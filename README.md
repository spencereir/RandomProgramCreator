RandomProgramCreator
====================

You thought your idea was bad? This is worse.

Seriously, this is a bad idea to run. I don't even know what will happen

At the moment, it doesn't do much, but when it is done, it will download random
blocks of code from StackOverflow, and create a program out of those. What will
it do? I have NO IDEA.

EDIT: Program completed.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The majority of the time it doesn't work,
but the benefit to all this is that you get some random program with a slew of errors
in it, the perfect place to train your C debugging skills. And then, of course, whether
it worked the first time or you had to manually debug it, you get to see the glorious
result (Which is typically a bunch of random and unrelated numbers and strings).
