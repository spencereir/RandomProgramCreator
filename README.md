RandomProgramCreator
====================

You thought your idea was bad? This is worse.

Seriously, this is a bad idea to run. I don't even know what will happen

At the moment, it doesn't do much, but when it is done, it will download random
blocks of code from StackOverflow, and create a program out of those. What will
it do? I have NO IDEA.
